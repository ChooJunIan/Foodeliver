# Foodeliver

A simplified food delivery management system. The programme is made entirely in Java, accompanied with their respective Javadocs. 

There are 4 roles in total:
1. Admin - the administrator of Foodeliver who is responsible for adding riders in the system. The admin can also view the rider queue, all consolidated order histories, and order statistics in the system.
2. Restaurant – a restaurant can add/update/delete its menu in Foodeliver, view order history, and update order status (preparing, ready, delivering, collected, etc.)
3. Customer – a customer can purchase food from Foodeliver, view order status and history, and collect food at the restaurant if self-collect is the choice.
4. Rider – a rider can deliver an order, view order status and history, and check how many moreriders before his turn. The system assigns orders to riders based on queue.
